//let say we are calculating area of circle which is 5 times radius square 

const PI = 3.14; //because value of  Pi will never reassigned and const will throw an err if we try to, so we can go and have a look where PI is reassigned

const Max_SIZE = 100; //to declare an array and we want maximum size of array we can have const

// here we have 2 variable whose values constantly being reassigned, so in such senario we'll use let keyword
