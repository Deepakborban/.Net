Commands 
npm install typescript -g          // to install typescript globally 
tsc --init                         //this will create a tsconfig.json file, which was configuration file for typescript compiler 
npm install lite-server -g         //to install lite-server globally
lite-server                        //to run lite server     

VarHosting : In var Hosting, any declaration will be moved to the very top of the function
             If we have declared var multiple times also, So behind the scene java script is rewritten to have a single declaration of the variable ignoring any duplicate declarations 
             So you can redclare var variable within the same scope or different
             means suppose you have 1st initialesed a variable and at the middle or end of the code you have declared that as var variable then also  it works because of var hosting 


Functional Scope of var Variable:
var Declaration has Functional Scope means weather you are declaring it within if block or else or for loop, the valuse would be accessible within the function

Now because of hosting and functional scope, var declaration seems to be bit tricky
because of that ES2015 has introduced Let keyword

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let Keyword : In ES2015 we got  Let keyword to declare variables 
              they are not Hosted (so you cannot use that before declaration ) and they were block scoped 
              to make let variable accessible within the function we can declare the let variable to the top of function
              you  cannot ReDeclare Let keyword within the same scope however you can in different scope 


So let was introduced to replace the var in long run 

@@ Conclusion @@ var use karna hi ni hai let and const hi karna hai

Const VS Let

Use Const over let 
because most of the variable we us, usually require 1 time initialization and never really reassigned, 
also by using the const keyword it helps us to identify variables which are getting reassigned  when that wan't really our intention 

Use Let when reassigment is expected and use const when a new value assignment is not expected

Arrow Funtion : it is the syntax addition to ES2015 to write a function
                Provide short and consize syntax for writing function and they also simplyfy the behavior of this keyword in javascript

                - reduce the amount of code that we write 
                - solve the problem that is caused by this

Default function parameter

Now in ES5 or java Script when a parameter is not specified for a function during its call then the value will be undefined 
But now in ES2015 we can set default values for parameters in paranthesis using assignment operator 
if you call this function with a value  it will log the value if you don't call it with a value it will pass the default value
let getValue = function(value = 10){  
    console.log(value); 
} 

We can have a functions with 2 or more parameters
if you don't want to pass the parameter on right hand side simply ignore it 
if you don't want to pass parameter on left hand side pass undefined 
you can take a value that is specified already i.e value on the left hand side you can use this parameter to specify a default parameter that occurs on the right hand side 
but you cannot assign bonus to value because there is no look ahead so value does not know what the value of bonus is 

we can also pass variables as assignments to our parameters
we can also pass function to this default 


arguments object : it only takes in the parameters passed and ignore the default values
