<!-- SO by this we are styling our element in the same page
    *****************Internal styling*****************************
so this is the PAGE LEVEL STYLING  -->

<!-- <style>
        p{
            color:yellow;
        }
    </style> -->

<!-- now if we create a website which have multiple web pages so style of all the pages should be similar
other wise it looks odd or not good so all the para should have same font and all the heading should have same font and all
so will i keep writing the same code again and again between all the pages
chalo ek baar kar bhi diya par client ne bola ki deepak ye paragraph ka color change karo
so i have to goto all the pages and keep modify the all pages accross the website-->

<!--*************SOLUTION for this is******************* -->
<!-- create a different css file and use that particular css file here
How do we do this
Remember------the css file falls under the dynamic pages or falls uder the value added objects
  it is used in a static page but they are not static page content it is nor use to print something on the screen
        this is to formate something on the screen
    so it is a value added object its not that ki without that i acnnot do anything i still have a content you can see that my website is still there
but i use css to add more value to my page

thats a reason when ever you create css make sure you create a css folder
dont add it in a root folder directly-->


<!-- so i create a folder name it css
we can call it css or style it depends on a company again some say style some say css it depends -->

<!-- now how to use this particular .css file in our .html file
so we link this page on the pages where we want to apply this css

 for this in head section just write
<link rel="stylesheet" href="here just specify the css file path just like what we have did with imgaes " >   -->
<!-- ********************External styling************************** -->

<!-- link is use to link many other things thats why we have mentioned here  what is the type  i am trying to link here
we are linking "Stylesheet" -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

</head>
<body>
<!-- there are may ways to change move color .....style the element
        one of the most fastest and significant which we usually use if  it is only one or two element in the entire page which i want to heighlight
SO in this case we always go with the
**********************inline styling*****************************
   -->
<!-- i want to change the heading of this particular para
so i just put syle specify font family to what ever we want-->
    <h1 style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Headings 1</h1>
<!-- means i want change the color of this particular para
so i just put a style here then i'll specify color to red -->
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>
    <p>This is my para 1</p>
    <p>This is my para 1</p>
    <p>This is my para 1</p>
    <p>This is my para 1</p>

<!--PROBLEM 1--------but this becomes difficult you to handle
when ever you want to work with multiple same element and i want to heighlight them
now i cant just keep doing this if its a huge application-->

<!-- PROBLEM 2----------Debugging becomes difficult -->

<!-- PROBLEM 3-----------Maintainance become difficult
what do i meant with maintainance
suppose i showed it to my client and client said that deepak this red color is not looking good
can you please change it to some other color then i have to come back to each line
change color in each line  -->
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>
    <p style="color: red;">This is my para 1</p>

<!--*********** SOLUTION for this is ************** -->
<!-- we write css in head section
for this we specify <style> and ill say which is the element i want to style
    in our case the element is p so i'll just specify p{color: yellow}
</style> -->

</body>

<!--+++++++++++++++********SUMMARY**********++++++++++++++++++++++++++= -->
<!-- What are the 3 ways of styling
Inline ------- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal ------ by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External ------- by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file-->


<!-- aagar hume teeno styling likh di for some element to
heighest priority given to inlne styling----inline me jo likha hai wo apply hoga baaki 2 nai-->

<!-- but when we come to internal or external
here order matter
like in head section if you write like this


<style>
        p{
            color:yellow;
        }
</style>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">



in this case our dom structure see that p ka color red to red kar dega
fir dekhega link me jaake ki .css me to p ka color yellow hai to yellow kar dega -->

<!-- and if we write like This


<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

<style>
    p{
        color:yellow;
    }
</style>


to 1st dom  dekhega ki link me yellow to yellow kar dega
fir internal styling me dekhega ki p ka color red to yellow hata ke red kardega  -->


<!--thats why always write link on the top kyuki wo css hume saare page pe same chahiye -->
<!--then use internal kyuki wo sirf is page pe apply karna hai-->
<!-- then write inline kyuki wo sirf usi line pe apply karna hai -->

<!-- to check run this on browser inspect goto element then style and observe-->


<!-- ab teeno likhe inline internal or external
teeno me alag alag chij likhi
inline me color dere.
internal me font size dere
external me font-family dere

to our dom structure inline se color lelega
internal se font size lelega
external se font family lelga

#################********means  css inherit or thake the information from its parent or the other css what we have *****************########### 


or agar teeno me ek hi parameter diya hai to it goes the order in which we have write them -->
