<!-- Whatis div?
-----------so div is a blocked container
when ever you create a particular div we are creating here 
will gone to block the whole row -->
<!-- what do you mean by that? (blocking the whole row)
======so to understand this i create a paragraph -->
<!-- and below that i wrote a line -->

    <p>This is p1</p> This is outside the p1   
<!-- this is outside the p1 output me next line me print hoga 
kyu?
paragraph to chota sa hai to usi line me print hona chahiye
-------because this elements are blocked elements
when you inspect element and see user agent stylesheet 
it says display:block; 
meaning ------it will block the whole row 
irrespective weather you write a  . or you write a whole line dosent matter
-->

<!-- same as your div so div are also blocked element  -->
    <div class="d1"></div>
    <div class="d2"></div>
    <div class="d3"></div>

<!-- but instead of div or p if you write <span> -->
    <span>This is p1</span> this is outside p1
<!-- now this particular content comming next to it because is not a blocked element 
if we want to block our span so inside css we can write 

display:block; -->
