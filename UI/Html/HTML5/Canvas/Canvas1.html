    <!-- to create canvas we have canvas tag  -->
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"
style="border:1px solid #d3d3d3;">
<!-- if your browser does not support the canvas so canvas will become null 
    so at that particular point of time my browser put a message saying Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag. -->
Your browser does not support the HTML5 canvas tag.</canvas>
<!-- to draw i have wrute little bit of java script  -->
<script>
    // i want to read the canvas i want to draw something on canvas so i should know where exactly my canvas is 
    //so to know my canvas or to get object of my canvas iam reading  that canvas by the id 
    // document.getElementById("myCanvas") getting canvas element by id so now the canvas object is stored in variable c 

    //this line is to read element based id
    var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
    //now we got the object so you need to know where i have to draw it 
    //i have such  a big canvas so ihave to set weather its a 2d diagram or the 3d diagram
    // so to do that we need to specify the canvas type here so we specify context here 
    var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
    //now i have to stat painting so i'll move my brush so first value is for x 2nd is for y 
    ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
//so draw the line to 100,100 so it has drawn the line but has not printed yet 
    ctx.lineTo(100, 100); 
    //so to print we have to say stroke(); as soon as you say stroke it will draw the line 
    ctx.stroke();
