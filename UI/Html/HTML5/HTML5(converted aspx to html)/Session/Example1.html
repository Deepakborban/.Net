        so in this button i'll say onclick when use clicks on this particular button i am calling the clickcounter function -->
        <p><button onclick="clickCounter()" type="button">Click me!</button></p>
        <!-- and this div is very important for me because this is the place where i get the number printed -->
        <div id="result"></div>
        <p>Click the button to see the counter increase.</p>
        <p>Close the browser tab (or window), and try again, and the counter will continue to count (is not reset).</p>
