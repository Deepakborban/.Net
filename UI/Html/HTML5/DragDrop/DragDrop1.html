//so in the drag event what i am doing , i am tracking which is the controll there may be multipe controlls na 
//we may have multiple images so i should know which is the image which user is trying to drag so that like when somebody drops it here 
// i can capture the id of that and i can get the particular object inside it here 
        function drag(ev) {
            //so to do that i am recording it here 
            //ev is the event what we are passing event is the object i am capturing that event object 
            //from event object we have a property called datatransfer so in that property we are setting the key and value 
            //text is the key and ev.target.id is the value 
            //so it will set the id of the draged image so id of the draged image is drag1 
            //so drag1 we be stored with the event object 
            //now my event object has the id stored in it 
            //drag = click event + move event
            ev.dataTransfer.setData("text", ev.target.id);
        }
// now drop event means releasing the mouse  
//while droping i'll take the event object now previously the event object is already has the id   
// in draging i'll say set , in droping i'll say get , get this particular key ,so in var data i get the object

        function drop(ev) {
            // this is imp -->preventDefault
            //usually what happens when i don't want a particular event/ the default event of the controll to get executed 
            //for example:-in the form we have a submit button here when you click on submit button what will happen -->it will submit to action which we have passed
            //but if i don't want this event to be fired / i dont want this form to be submitted 
            //so what i can do is , i can run this prevent default for that submit 
            // meaning even thoe you clicked on that submit buttom the form will not submit 
            //so where can we use this where is the place where you are clicking on the button but still you are not submitting the form 
            //--------->may be this can be written whereever you are writing personalize javascript 
            //usually what happens whenever you are writing personalize java script you may write a personalize message here like please enter this name 
            // please enter this password ,you would have written a validation code for the javascript when user clicks on ok to this popup til the form get submitted
            //at that time we use preventDefault 
            ev.preventDefault();
            var data = ev.dataTransfer.getData("text");
            //to that particular object  the target event value will be this one div  so appendchild to this 
            // what is the child object so i'll say document.getElementById(data)
            //what is there in the data --------------> it has teh id of the object which we have dragged 
            ev.target.appendChild(document.getElementById(data));
