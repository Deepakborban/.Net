          The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window.


When you click on this submit button what happens 
-------- fill form and click on the url area in browser where we write website name 
           and see what happen   ITS TRYING TO PUSH SOME DATA     -->



<!-- name me jo likha hai wo as key jaeha and jo user enter karega wo as value jaega
        now when you submit this the information will be posted to the server 
         and server will send the response 
        now to which resource i need to send in the server that should be mention in the  action
        so action says to which page it has to go  -->
<!--suppose we create a file name success.html here  (Please keep this in mind we never go for the static page)-->
  <!-- action move us to the page written inside it and pass the keys and values user have entered -->

  <!-- BUT there is a problem you can see that the password is exposed here along with all our detail
  http://127.0.0.1:5501/HTML/success.html?cpassword=deepak8959&gender=on&hobbies=on&hobbies=on&states=Madhya+Pradesh&file=duckett.pdf 
so if you have and sensitive information which you dont want to get exposed like password
so usually we embeed all this data inside the request object (how to fetch this data we will see in asp.net)
to do that inside method attribute we write******** post******through this our data not go with the url rater it go with the request object-->
      <form action="success.html" method="post">
        <label for="name">Enter your name :</label>
        <!--ill just type here name="name" -->
        <input type="text" name="" id="name"><br>

<!-- now click on the url and observe how it looks
its look like this-----
http://127.0.0.1:5501/Example9.1.html?cpassword=deepak8959&gender=on&hobbies=on&hobbies=on&states=Madhya+Pradesh&file=duckett.pdf  
see whole details will be revealed here
from where did i get all this information 
what is this name 
what is this cpassword
what is this gender .......
in the url
-------ye sab wo hai jo humne name="  " ke andar likha hai   
///////////////////name me jo likha hai wo as key jaeha and jo user enter karega wo as value jaega////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    so this particular data is pushed to this particular page called Example9.1.html
  in server side  meaning we are gone to push this information to your dynamic page whatever we are creating here
from UI we are pushing this information to web service or to bussiness layer -->

<!-- now in our example it is taking it to Example9.1 page but in reality it is not be a particular page
rather in java world its been a servlet
       in .net world it will be push to your controller and the controller knows what exactly it has to do with this data
    so it takes this particular data manupulate it or store it what ever it want to
then finally it send the response back-->


<!--*********** SO name is used to access this client side data in the server side *********** 
  so name is basically use to gather/ push this particular information from the client side to server side
when ever we are calling the server side code you want to push this particular data to the server
this is a key from which i get the value (server side)-->

<!-- <input type="text" name="" id="name"><br> -->


<!--***********ID are basically use to get or manupulate the data of this particular element 
                          at the client side(meaning browser side)
                        and this is also a key from which i get the value(client side)-->

<!-- In the javascript if i want to get this particular data so you can get it from both the way
you can get it from the name or from the ID thats the different story  

             but id is always ideal -->



<!-- so the comparison of this can be done at the client side or at the server side (the choice is yours) 
      but when you talk about the security i dont want to write any sort of javascript and scrope my server side coding
      so in this case we write all this particular information at server side-->



    <h1 style="color: green;">the comparison of pass and confirm pass can be done at client side or at the server side the choice will be your
    you can do this at client side using java script </h1>

<!-- right now to make this looks good use table  -->

<h1>This is how URL of this form goes on submit</h1>
<p style="color: red;">http://127.0.0.1:5501/form.html?name=Deepak+Borban&password=deepak8959&cpassword=deepak8959&gender=on&hobbies=on&hobbies=on&hobbies=on&state=Madhya+Pradesh&address=C%2FL-220</p>
<h3>but this is not secure as this will reveal our info</h3>
<h4>this data is reveal from here name="name" name="password"............</h4>
<p>so this data is comming to where?    this particular data is pushed to this particular page called form.html in the server side  
    In the server all this data is pushed t√≥ his page meaning  we will gone to puch this information to the dynamic page
    What ever we are creating here  we are pushing that info to webservice or to bussiness layer


    So this particular data is important now in our case ittaking us to this particular page but 
    in reality it will not be a particular page rather this will be a servelet in java world and in .net world it will be your controller

    so this information will go to the controller and the controller and the controller know what it has to do with this data 
    so it take data and do what ever it wants like storing or manupulating and send the respose back 
</p> 
<h1 style="color: rgb(75, 66, 14);">SO name is used to access the client side data in server side    Or   to push the info from the client side to server side </h1>


<h1>What about Id then?</h1>
<h2 >Id are basically use to get or manupulate the data of this particular element at the client side meaning browser side</h2>

<h1 style="color: rgb(58, 23, 58);">name is used to play with this data at the server side  THIS IS A KEY from which i'll get the value<br>
Id is also a key form which i'll get the value but at client side <br>
and id should be unique or ideal</h1>

<input type="submit">	Displays a submit button (for submitting the form)
<input type="button">	Displays a clickable button

<!--Lable tag

The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, 
because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions 
(such as radio buttons or checkboxes) 
- because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, 
    it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the 
id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.-->
