        //now what is binding your html code with the javascript code ? 
        //binding means what is making it to work , what is making this div to call this function----------onclick
        //so the event is one which will bind your UI program with your javascript code if i dont write this i will not get this alert at all
        //it is the click which does the magic 

        //so what i do here i will write a function
        function init() {
            //now what my init function will do, i'll write this binding 
            //i'll write event binding code here for all the buttons this and that here
            //now this will be very easy for me i have the complete UI code and my event binding is already done in my java script 
            //so i'll not bother to go back and writing onclick in div , i'll never do that 

            //we know that  how to call this init is'nt it, as soon as my body gets loaded or may be in my window object 

            console.log("Hi");//on window load i am calling this init which will print me hi


            //But how will you bind now, how can i get this div object in java script ------------i can go with the Id or I can go with the class 
            //but here this is a print message so i want this printMessage funtion to be called on the click of this particular button not any other button
            //like when you click on + mark you want to call only the addition method you dont want to call the subraction also thats a reason we will go with id
            //so id will always be unique all of know that 

            let btnObject = document.getElementById("btnPrintMessage"); // here i am not writing the .value so i will get the whole object
            //no to this button i'll say addeventlistener
            //what my addeventlistner does its taking a parameter it will take keyof HTMLElementEventMap, listner
            //meaning what is the event which you have to bind -------click event,    onclick is a handler pls remember 
            //and who is the caller who is the handler for it, when you click on this which method i have to call -------printMessage()
            btnObject.addEventListener('click', printMessage); //we will not write () after function here means you should not call that event i am binding it  

            //now tommorow if bussiness will say i dont want this button lets go with another one so what is the change i have to do?
            //-----we just have to put the particular id there 


            //so pls segregate your UI code with js code never write onclick that and this at all......

            //but in some places like may be in the framework they will specify this , you have to write the particular binding 
            //for example in angular if want to have a particular button to perform some kind of click event so they will gone to use the event handler
            //within a () i'll specify click and is equal to what method i have o call , so that we do 

            //but if yo want to write  a pure javascript or vanilla javascript and want to segrigate so you can always do this magical things look at this it is so beautiful
            //so meaning i have to just create all the design and forget 
            //i just have to make sure that i remember id , id becomes important for me because wihout id i cannot tag 
            //so the contract between the designer and the developer is this id 
        }

        window.onload = function(){
            init();
        }
        //this is the handler
        function printMessage() {
            alert("Welcome");
        }
