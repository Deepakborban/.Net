    <!-- <button onclick="printMessage()">Print Message </button> -->

     <div class="msg">print message</div>


<!-- look at this i am merging my UI code with some other aditional information which is very bad , So i am merging my UI code with
the event code/script code 
so can we with a particular code which will segrigate which will make sure my UI code is not at all getting merged with my html
meaning i dont want any one to write onclick.....in div 
Can we do something like that so that my html code is completely seprate and my script code is completely seprate  they are not at all merged
remember i am a UI designer here when you talk about ui we have 2 different type of people who will be comming here 
1. UI Designer
2. UI Developer
developer will sit and write this JavaScript code 
designers job is to get  the template creating UI getting that gradient colors when user moves cursor in it .....
now when you are wearing the hat of a ui developer so i will consentrate only on developnment , i will not go to designing 

but now we have merged every thing when i say i am a UI developer you have to do both the jobs you cant say you know what i can understand only
java script i cannot understand HTML -->
    <script>
        //   SO when you work with JQUERY What we usually do is we will gone to specify the same kind of code when ever the
        // document object is ready or whenever the window is ready thats where we start writting some of the code 

        //so when the document is ready so usually we write a function like this 
        function init() {
        }
        //when my document object is ready, thats what we have written in previous code in body onload, so i dont want to write all this 
        //code i want to write it seprately so you can write all those things in this script
        //so, we will differenciate ,we will segrigate the UI code with the script code we will not merge the ui code with the script code 

        //what does it mean 
        //for ex:- on a particular button  i want to print a particular message like Print message 
        //now imagine that its a very simple appication 
        //and when user clicks on this i want to get a alert 
        //so in the button we have to mention onclick
        function printMessage() {
            alert("Welcome");
        }
        //so this is what we do 
        //but what happens here ,imagine that we have lot of css and html, so now my client will say deepak you kow what,
        //this button is not looking good can you change the style of it 
        //so instead of writing this button i will put a div here
