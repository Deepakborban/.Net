    <p>when you go here <a href="https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/">click here</a>it says how it
        works </p>
    <p>can you see download here <a href="https://jquery.com/download/">click here</a> it gives you 2 options </p>
    <p>1. you can download this entier jquery plugin to your local and then embedd that in your file and then work</p>
    <p>2. you can always use cdn for it <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries"> click here</a> this is
        the cdn link----script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js">/script </p>
    <p>what is CDN?</p>
    <p>CDN stands for content delivery network</p>
    <p>all of know about request and response correct </p>
    <p>request is send from the client to the server and server will send response back to the client</p>
    <p>what server will send as a response </p>
    <img src="../js_images/71.PNG" alt="">
    <p>suppose i am saying pls go to www.amazon.com/index.html -------so i am requesting to this index page
        so when we snd request to this particular page ,so what my server does is it will take this particular page and
        all the VAO's value added objects associated to it all the files associated to it, it will send all of them
        together
    </p>
    <img src="../js_images/72.PNG" alt="">
    <p>when i go to amazon.in and go to network and observe</p>
    <img src="../js_images/73.PNG" alt="">
    <p>i've request for amazon.in but look at how much content the serve is sending , it is sending all this gif ,js
        files, xhr-xml http request, .jpg.........</p>
    <p>so it will send all this information back to the client, so while doing so if i have written a script code here
        ,may be i have written a external javascript, may be you have written 10000 or 20000 lines of code and you have
        add that script here </p>
    <img src="../js_images/74.PNG" alt="">
    <p>and when the request is came to the jquery2.html when it is send then the js file also be sent from server to the
        client </p>
    <p>remember all of this are comming from the same server , from the same location and that may create lot of traffic
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>so thats a reason we'll have this content delivery network, imagine my request is comming from india and my
        server is present in austraila, my application is deployed in australian server</p>
    <p>when the request is comming from indian server to australian server and the australian server will send this
        files back to the india it will take lot of time </p>
    <img src="../js_images/75.PNG" alt="">
    <p>so instead of me writing this if i write a cdn link </p>
    <img src="../js_images/76.PNG" alt="">
    <p>so now the request will go from the indian server to this CDN and this cdn server may be close to india , we
        called it content delivery meaning i am trying to access this particular information</p>
    <p>now take a example this amazon had a particular big billion day where i have ordered for a particular phone now
        the manufacturar of that phoe is in mumbai now when i'm sending a particular request instead of it going to
        mumbai and getting that particular product may be like mumbai guy, if he had godown in indore it can get it from
        indore na it will be faster </p>
    <p>the cdns are like this ,they are like a godown which is close to the particular place from where we are sending
        the request</p>
    <p><b>https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js</b></p>
    <p>it is going to googleapi and from there it is downloading that particular file meaning it will not go to my place
        and it will not get the content from my server rather it will go call the google api now google api may have a
        particular server in mumbai , so any request which ask for this jquery file so instead of going till australian
        server to get the particular content it will get it from mumbai so it will be faster in delivering that
        particular request</p>
    <p><b>so thats why in PRODUCTION -------imagine that i have downloaded the lib-->jquery-3.6.0.min.js</b></p>
    <p>now if i want to use the jquery what i have to do, we will just specify jquery file path name</p>
    <img src="../js_images/77.PNG" alt="">
    <p>this is in the developnment machine but before pushing it to the production we will replace this line of code
        with the CDN link</p>
    <img src="../js_images/78.PNG" alt="">
    <p>Now why are we doing this -----because this will take less time to load that particular file </p>
    <p>min.js is for production it is minified version </p>
    <p>where as .js is the normal file </p>
    <p>you can also compress and make minified version of your .js file , for this you have plenty of online tools</p>
    <p>minified version is not only to remove space and comments but it will replace variables functions so it does lot
        of magical things for you whenever you are going with minified version</p>
        <img src="../js_images/79.PNG" alt="">
        <p>see the space difference between normal file vs minified version</p>
        <p>if i go with cdn link in developnment version, so every time when i load the file it goes to this link and downloads that particular file and that may take lot of time in developnment</p>
        <p>thats why for developnment we use saved js lib</p>
