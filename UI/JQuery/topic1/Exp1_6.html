        <p>Hi, we are now learning about <em>jQuery</em>. jQuery is a <em>client</em> side scripting language
        which helps UI developer to develop Web2.0 component without using flash.</p>
        
        <p>Use the <em>.find()</em> method to create a new wrapper set of elements based on the context
        of the current set and their descendants. For example, say that you have a web page
        that contains several paragraphs..</p>
        
        <p>Encapsulated inside of these paragraphs are words that are <em>empharized</em>. If you'd like to
        select only certain elements contained within container elements, you could do something else to
        fetch the data...</p>
        
        <script type="text/JavaScript">
                jQuery('h1').css('border','1px solid #333333');
        </script>
    </body>
