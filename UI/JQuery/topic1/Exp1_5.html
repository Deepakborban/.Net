        <p>Hi, we are now learning about <em>jQuery</em>. jQuery is a <em>client</em> side scripting language
        which helps UI developer to develop Web2.0 component without using flash.</p>
        
        <p>Use the <em>.find()</em> method to create a new wrapper set of elements based on the context
        of the current set and their descendants. For example, say that you have a web page
        that contains several paragraphs..</p>
        
        <p>Encapsulated inside of these paragraphs are words that are <em>empharized</em>. If you'd like to
        select only certain elements contained within container elements, you could do something else to
        fetch the data...</p>
        
        <script type="text/JavaScript">
                alert('The three paragraphs in all contain ' + jQuery('p').find('em').length +  ' italic words');
                //here we are counting number of em tags 
                //here from the paragraph tag we saying the find method
                //and i am finding for all the em's 

                //now imagine you have to do the same thing using java script so how will you do that 
                //you should use a queryseclector or else you can use getElementsBy em   that is little difficult it is not this easy and then find the length of it 
        </script>
