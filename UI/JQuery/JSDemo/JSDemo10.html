            //so remember this whenever you are creating variable using var so that values can be easiely retrived 
            //meaning scope of var is to the entire function where ever you create dosent matter
            //so it will be to the entire function because it will attached to the document object 


            //but where as when you talk about let so let becomes a local variable 
            //so let will have life only in the sope where ever they are created 
            //outside that it will say boss you dont have any variable like that


            //so usually what we do in angular and other places we use the keyword let to create the variable we'll not be use var
            //because of this reason if you create a var then the scope will change you can use the variable in the entire function but i dont want to do that 
            // i just want to strict my data as much as possible because i want it to be protected 
            //so if you talk about protection so you should always create variable using let keyword
