    <input type="text" name="" id="txtName" placeholder="Enter your Name">
    <button onclick="printName()">Click me</button>


<!-- i want to read some data from the textbox and print it on the screen or print it in a message 
now there are few things which you have to remember 
whenever you want to grab some data java script will allow us to get the data from the dom object  -->
    <script>
        function printName() {
//now i need to get the object here so i'll say var nameobj = document........
//there are many ways to do this but we will always go with document object
//why document object because when you come back to browser and inspect and
// i'll say document in console so you can see that the whole area get covered ,
//so document get cover the whole area the complete screen
//there are 2 most imp things which you should always remember
//1 is document object 
//2 nd is window object----------window is generalize to the complete window-------
//like closing tab is a part of  window object changing the tab loosing afocus from one tab and getting the focus
// of other tab is the part of window object
// ------window.toolbar,  enabeling microphone , audio video all this is the part of toolbar
//-------window.navigator.geolocation.latitude we have seen this in html5



//document is related to the code which you seen on screen and window cover the whole screen 
           // var nameObj = document.getElementById("txtName"); //this give you whole object
            var nameValue = document.getElementById("txtName").value;  //this will give you only the value
            //i got the value so now i can put it in the alert 
            alert("welcome " + nameValue + " to java Script");
        }
    </script>
