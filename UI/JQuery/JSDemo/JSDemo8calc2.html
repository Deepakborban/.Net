            //so bussiness will say in place of alert rather we can put a label
            //so today i  put label tommorow they say put it in div and give a fancy stuff day after tommorow they may say
            //put some where so now we are written every thing in a same file so it is easy i can come back here and i can modify 
            //but imagine you are writting a very big and complex project where you are writting a particular process and with that 
            //you have multiple files which handle multiplication , addition, subtraction and division these are 4 different file 
            //so the complexity of code increases 

            //so when i come back here so if the output code is the part of controller so it will always be problematic 

            //like you are giving the order to server guy and he go take the food from chef and serve you 
            //so he is doing multiple jobs there like he is serving you + doing cleaning job also but cleaning is not his job
            // like that printing the outputis not the job calculate function
            //So this output part should not be the part of this calculate method 

            //so i remove this and call printResult(result) function and i pass this result as a parameter

            printResult(result);
            //now look at this code this is purely doing process job it is not having process related code it is not having output related code 
            //so tommorow if i want to change something related to output so i will be knowing ok this particulr code is written in this file 
            //so i go to that particular file and just modify that 
             


        }
        //output

            //to print as a alert
           // alert('Result is :' + result);

            //to print in label 
            var lblResult = document.getElementById("lblResult");//so i get the whole object
            //if it is a text box so we say document.getElementById("txtNo2").value;  so .value will get you the value 
            //in the same way if you want to get the data from the label or if you want to print some data into the label
            //so label has a property called --------------innerText or innerHtml
            //lblResult.innerText = "Result is " + result;
            
            //i want to display Result is in bold so to bold any thing in html we use b tag right
           // lblResult.innerText = "<b>Result is </b>" + result; // here it is treating everything as a text but <b>is not a text right its a html tag
            //so  i want to treat that as a html tag so if the output has any html content we cant use innertext
            //there we use ------------------innerHtml------------------------
            lblResult.innerHTML = "<b> Result is : </b>" + result;
