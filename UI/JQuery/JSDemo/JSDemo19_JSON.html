        function getData() {
            //imagine i have reading the data from the inputs 
            let name = "Deepak";
            let mark1 = 30;
            let mark2 = 40;
            let mark3 = 50;
            //and i want to calculate the total and the result 
            //so ho do we do that 
            //but we know that we should not mix the ui code with the process code 
            let result = calculateResult(mark1, mark2, mark3);
            printResult(result);
        }

            alert(result);

        //now imagine tommorow bussiness will grow and they will say add one more   mark then i have to 
        //come back to calculateResult method and modify there also
        //after some time bussiness will come back with some other requirementthey will say add one more mark mark5
        //then again we have to come every where and make changes 

        //so in object oriented world what we do we will wrap all this information in a object
        //and we wil not pass this like mark1, mark2, mark3.......

        //so here java script also wrap all this information in form of a object 


        //how can we do this  


        function getStudentData() {
            //we create a variable student and inside this put every thing in a key and value pair




            // let student = {
            //     name: "Deepak",
            //     mark1: 30,
            //     mark2: 40,
            //     mark3: 5
            // };




            //now  i get the whole object  ,so i can take this object and instead of me logging it i can pass this whole object to 
            //calculateStudentResult() so in the calculate i can say student.name   student.mark1   student.mar2...................
            //and we can fetch the particular value 


           // console.log('name' + student.name);//like this we can fetch the data
          //  console.log(student);

            //Remember in JSON whenever you want to create a object you have  to open a flower bracket and close it 

            //so in programming world how will you store the data mark1 mark2....will i store it in seprate variable or we put it in container
            //------we can put them inside array
            //why should i put them inside array----if you store it in array so it will be easy to store and fetch the data 
            //so fetching and storing will be easy for us 
            //so thats a reason we usually put them inside the array   


            let student = {
                name: "Deepak",
                marks: [30, 40, 50]   //remember whenever you want to put a particular array you should always put it inside a square brackets
            };
            console.log(student);
            //now how will i access mark1
            console.log('Mark1  ' + student.marks[0]);





            // let result = calculateResult(mark1,mark2,mark3);
            // printResult(result);
        }

        function calculateStudentResult(mark1, mark2, mark3) {
            return (mark1 + mark2 + mark3);
        }

        function printStudentResult(result) {
            alert(result);
        }

        //lets call getStudentData() directly
        getStudentData();
