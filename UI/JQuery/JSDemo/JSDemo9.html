    <p> my functions job is to read the data from the screen </p>
    <p>imagine that user has already entered the number and the number is 10 and 20</p>
    <p> var no1 = 10;
        <br> <br>var no2 = 20;
        <br> <br> now you have to understand 1 thing very carefully how the functions will work
        <br> <br> whenever you write a particular function we will have 3 parts in it
        <br> <br> 1.return type
        <br> <br> 2nd function name
        <br> <br> 3rd parameter


        <br> <br> its not compultion to have parameter
        <br> <br> if my function wont return any thing so ill say void ----------void fun(){}
        <br> <br> and to call this function i write-------------fun1();
        <br> <br> any thing to the caller it means i am calling this function and this function is not writtening
        anything
        <br> <br> its like you are giving 10 rs to a children and saying go eat something but yaha aap 10rs bhi nahi de
        rahe
        ho
        <br> <br> you are just saying to the kid ki go have choclate
        <br> <br> so what that particuar guy will do he will buy the choclate or eat some thing or dont do anything its
        his
        job
        <br> <br> nor this guy will comeback and tell to you anything nor you are bothered about that guy
        <br> <br> so nither you are passing any parameter to this function nor this function is bothered to returning to
        you
        <br> <br> you are just calling the function and he is performing his job
        <br> <br> now suppose there is diwali and you are giving 10 rs to that child------------ fun2(10);
        <br> <br> and you will say go have choclate
        <br> <br> now when you are giving 10s to kid so needs to have pocket to take money and keep it
        <br><br> what he does he keep this in pocket no1 -----------void fun2(int no1){}
        <br><br> no1 is the pocket where the 10 will be pushed now by saying void you are not expecting to that child ki
        come back to you
        <br> <br> and say what he had done with that 10rs you just give the value and you are not bothered and this
        child
        will do what ever he wantsto do with that money


        <br> <br> now we have fun3----------int fun3(int no1){ return no1+20; }
        <br> <br> what my fun3 does is it will take the aurgument ---it is taking number 1 and it is performing some
        operation with no1
        <br> <br> and he is returning some value------- may be you call some kid and give 10 rs to him and say go have
        fun
        <br> <br> so he already has 20rs with him so he take whatever the money you are giving he add 20rs to it
        <br> <br> he is comming back to you and giving that to you
        <br> <br> now when he is comming back and giving that to you so obviously you should have the value(pocket) to
        store
        that return value
        <br> <br> ------------int funValue = fun3(10);
        <br> <br> so here my function is called with parameter and it is returning something so i should have a
        placeholder
        store that value
      
    </p>
    <img src="../js_images/12.PNG" alt="">
    <p>now pls understand one very important thing </p>
    <p>any program you write it would be it would be most simplest ,silliest program like adding of two numbers or may
        be to print hellow followsed by the name of the user </p>
    <p>any program you write will have 3 parts in it </p>
    <p>1 is Input</p>
    <p>2nd will be the Process</p>
    <p>3rd will be the Output</p>
    <p><b>IPO</b>--input process output</p>
    <p>input will come from the user </p>
    <p>output is to the user </p>
    <p>process is for us </p>
    <p>for example- I am asking a user to enter 2 numbers so that becomes a input so he will put 1st number and 2nd
        number</p>
    <p>when user clicks on + button we need to do sum thats the process </p>
    <p>after the process the result what i am having i have to give it back to the user that becomes the output </p>
    <p>input and output we already have seen using html and css </p>
    <p>now today what we dealing is process related code so java script </p>
    <p>so in the java script what we do we read the data we will process that particular data and gives the output </p>
    <p>but in some cases we need to add an extra layer here we may have to go with the storage -------------IPOS</p>
    <p>meaning i am trying to store the data i have the processed data, the input data or the output data i ll take that
        processed data and store that data </p>
    <p>It can be using file handeling , it can be using Database</p>
    <p>once you store that particular data will pe permanently there</p>
    <p>it will be persisted and it will use the persisted data may be in later stages </p>
    <img src="../js_images/13.PNG" alt="">
    <p>Nowcomming back here to the question why can't we pass this particular value </p>
    <img src="../js_images/14.PNG" alt="">
    <p>if i return this calculated value </p>
    <img src="../js_images/15.PNG" alt="">
    <p>who is the caller who is calling this calculate method </p>
    <img src="../js_images/12.PNG" alt="">
    <p>here who is calling my fun1()---------main is calling </p>

    <p>similarly if i write return here so who is calling calculate method </p>
    <img src="../js_images/15.PNG" alt="">
    <p>this button is calling na ---onclick() is a event handler is'nt it so my this particular event will get calculate
        return here so where will you write the code to print the sum on the screen as output </p>
    <img src="../js_images/16.PNG" alt="">

    <p>one more question</p>
    <p>why are you calling one more funtion can't we directly write result=no1 + no2 here</p>
    <img src="../js_images/17.PNG" alt="">
    <p>like i know this is a + symbol so instead of writing one more function passing parameter to it then return the
        result so i can directly write na result=no1 + no2 </p>
    <p><b>we ca do this but it is not recommended because the job of my function is to controll the input and output</b>
    </p>
    <img src="../js_images/18.PNG" alt="">
    <p>just like when you go to hotel and in the hotel you have the server guy he will come and say mam sir please tell
        me what you want to have and you pic from the list and say i want to eat this then he go to that particular
        place and place order then chef will process the food and give to the server guy so he take the food and come
        and serve you </p>
    <p>will the server guy go to kitchen and will he prepare -------no that will never happen na </p>

    <p><b><b>this is Called SRP------Single Responsible Principle</b></b></p>
    <img src="../js_images/19.PNG" alt="">
    <p>so what is the job of this calculator ---it use to take the operator based on operator it will not sit and
        calculate it is not the job of this guy he is like a supplier </p>
